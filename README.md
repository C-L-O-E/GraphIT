# GraphIT
GraphIT is a visualization tool designed for computer science lessons, specifically focusing on algorithms. Although it is currently in an early stage of development, it holds tremendous potential.

Please bear with me as this is my first experience working with React. I kindly ask for your patience as I navigate the learning curve. While there are areas that require improvement, such as numerous tests and sections of code that could be enhanced for better readability and efficiency, I am committed to refining and optimizing them.

Looking ahead, my plan is to release regular updates to enhance GraphIT's functionality. One exciting feature on the horizon is the ability to export visualizations as PDF or image files. This functionality will facilitate presentations and allow users to distribute examples to students with ease. Additionally, I am eager to incorporate project loading capabilities, potentially even including dedicated tasks tailored for students' needs.

Rest assured that I will make every effort to ensure flawless English, devoid of any grammar mistakes, typos, or misspellings.
